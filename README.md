# Esp32 RC Car

Welcome to the ESP32 RC Car Project repository! This project aims to document the process of fixing an old RC car. The RC car has been restored to working condition, thanks to the use of an ESP8266 board, L293D motor driver, and other components.

## Features

- Control the RC car remotely using Wi-Fi connectivity.
- Utilize the L293D motor driver to drive the motors of the RC car.
- Play sounds using a piezo electric buzzer.

## Technologies Used

- **PlatformIO**: The development environment for this project is set up using PlatformIO within Visual Studio Code (VSCode). PlatformIO provides a seamless development experience for embedded systems, making it easy to compile, upload, and debug code for microcontroller-based projects.

- **ESP8266**: The RC car is powered by an ESP8266 microcontroller board, which provides Wi-Fi connectivity and serves as the brain of the car. The ESP8266 enables wireless communication between the car and the remote controller.

- **L293D Motor Driver**: The L293D motor driver is used to control the motors of the RC car. It allows bidirectional control of two DC motors, providing the necessary power and control to drive the wheels of the car.

- **Piezo Electric Buzzer**: A piezo electric buzzer is incorporated into the RC car to play sounds and provide auditory feedback. It can be programmed to produce various tones and melodies.

- **14-Volt Battery Pack**: The RC car is powered by a 14-volt battery pack, providing sufficient voltage and current to drive the motors and other electronic components of the car.
