**Restored my old rusty RC car to a working condition, In the process i've used the following components:**

- **PlatformIO**: The development environment for this project is set up using PlatformIO within Visual Studio Code.

- **ESP8266**: The RC car is powered by an ESP8266 microcontroller board, which provides Wi-Fi connectivity and serves a web page to control the car.

- **L293D Motor Driver**: The L293D motor driver is used to control the motors of the RC car. It allows bidirectional control of two DC motors.
